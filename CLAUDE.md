# Website "Guggenmusik Les Canetons de Fribourg" — Project Instructions

## Project Overview

Public website and members' area for the Guggenmusik **Les Canetons de Fribourg**
(a Fribourg carnival brass band). Public pages present the band (history, sections,
committee, sponsors, media, contact). A members' area, gated by login, lets members
respond to events (participate / not) and lets the admin ("Team Direction") manage
events and view attendance summaries.

## Tech Stack

- **PHP 8.4** (matches prod). `app/src/` classes are PSR-4
  autoloaded under the `App\` namespace via Composer.
- **MariaDB 10.3** (prod: 10.3.8) via the `mysqli` extension.
- **Vanilla JS + CSS** under `app/assets/`, built by **Vite** (`vite.config.js`)
  into `app/assets/dist/` — one entry per currently-independent `<script>`/
  page-CSS file, ES modules (native `import`/`export`, no framework), with
  content-hashed output and a `manifest.json` that `App\Assets`
  (`app/src/Assets.php`) reads to emit the right `<script type="module">`/
  `<link rel="modulepreload">`/`<link rel="stylesheet">` tags — the one
  mechanism both `head.php`/`footer.php` and `layout.html.twig` use, instead
  of hardcoding asset paths. `bulma`, `i18next`, and `lucide` are npm
  devDependencies bundled in at build time (not vendored static files).
- **Third-party PHP libraries are Composer dependencies** (e.g. `nikic/fast-route`,
  `phpmailer/phpmailer`, `shuchkin/simplexlsxgen`), installed into `app/vendor/`
  (the Composer/Docker install target — never hand-edited or committed). Vendoring
  a static, un-packaged file is the fallback only when no Composer package exists;
  third-party CSS is vendored this way today, under `app/assets/vendor/`.
- **Router:** `nikic/fast-route`, dispatched through a single front
  controller (`app/index.php`). Clean URLs; old `.php` URLs 301-redirect.
- **Apache** with `.htaccess` (front-controller rewrite + cache policy) on
  `easy-hebergement.net` shared hosting. PHP runs as **FastCGI** there, so the
  front-controller rule in `app/.htaccess` carries a `RewriteCond
  %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$` guard — without it the rewrite to `index.php`
  re-matches itself and loops into a 500. Don't remove it.
- **Build step:** `npm run build` assembles `app/` + a production-only
  Composer `vendor/` into a generated `public/` directory — the
  environment-agnostic code artifact. It deliberately excludes `config.php`
  (server-owned) but ships `config.example.php` next to it on every deploy —
  the live template, for diffing against a server's real `config.php` by
  hand. `public/` is git-ignored and never hand-edited.
- **Deployment (one gated CI pipeline):** all deploys run in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. A merge to `main` auto-deploys the built `public/`
  to **TEST**; **QA** then **PROD** are manual-approval gates in the *same run*
  (`deploy-qa` needs `deploy-test`, `deploy-prod` needs `deploy-qa`), enforced by
  **Required reviewers** on the `qa`/`prod` GitHub Environments. The run pauses at
  each gate until a maintainer approves. Because it is one run on one commit, QA
  and PROD get the exact bytes tested on TEST — no "resolve latest green commit"
  step. Every upload still **excludes the three server-owned files**
  (`.htaccess`, `robots.txt`, `config.php`). Those per-env files are placed once
  per server: `npm run build:overlay` generates them into `dist/overlay/<env>/`;
  `config.php` is always set by hand per server. See `staging/README.md`.
- **Automated TEST deploy (optional):** `npm run deploy:test` builds then
  uploads `public/` to the TEST server over plain FTP (creds from a git-ignored
  `.env`; see `.env.example`), printing per-file progress. It uploads only
  **new/changed** files (changed = different byte size; FTP timestamps aren't
  trusted on this host) and never uploads or prunes the server-owned files
  (`.htaccess`, `robots.txt`, `config.php`, `.htpasswd`). Flags: `-- --dry-run`
  (print the new/changed/unchanged/stale plan, change nothing — run this before
  `--prune`), `-- --prune` (also delete remote **plain files** the build no
  longer produces; directories/symlinks like `cgi-bin` and the protected files
  are always kept), `-- --force` (re-upload every file, for the rare edit that
  keeps a file's size identical). After a real upload it **verifies** every
  uploaded file is present on the server at the matching byte size (reusing the
  same LIST-based size check) and exits non-zero if any file is missing or
  truncated; `-- --no-verify` skips that check.
  The same `deploy.mjs` also powers `deploy:qa` and `deploy:prod`; each target
  hard-refuses to run unless its `FTP_DIR` matches the env name, so a mistyped
  dir can never deploy to (or `--prune`!) the wrong environment. Per-env config
  lives in a git-ignored `.env.<target>` (copy `.env.example`); the tooling loads
  `.env.<target>` then falls back to a shared `.env`.
- **Config-shape pre-flight check:** before uploading anything, `deploy.mjs`
  fetches the target's `config.php` and compares its key *shape* (never
  values — those are never logged) against `config.example.php`. Any drift
  (a key the code now expects that's missing, or one no longer expected)
  refuses the deploy with the exact key paths to fix — e.g. shipping a new
  `App\Features` flag without first adding it to a server's `config.php`
  fails that server's deploy instead of silently misbehaving. `--dry-run`
  reports the same drift without refusing. If `config.php` can't be fetched
  at all (a brand-new environment before initial setup), this only warns.
  The shape is read by *parsing* each `config.php` to an AST (`php-parser`, a
  pure-JS devDependency) and walking its top-level `return [ ... ]` — the file
  is never evaluated, so this needs no `php` binary and never executes the
  fetched server config. It assumes `config.php` stays a literal array (as it
  always is); a dynamic construct throws a clear error instead of under-reporting
  keys.
- **Automated DB migrations:** after each deploy, `npm run dbmigrate:<env>`
  triggers the token-gated server-side endpoint `POST /api/migrate`
  (`app/api/migrate.php` → `App\Migrator`), which applies `sql/migrations/*.sql`
  using the server's `config.php` DB connection (remote DB login is blocked, so
  migrations run server-side). It is a **separate step run after** `deploy:<env>`
  — deliberately not chained into it, so `deploy:<env> -- --dry-run` still reaches
  `deploy.mjs`. In CI it's a step after the deploy step (skipped if the deploy
  fails); locally run `npm run dbmigrate:<env>` after `npm run deploy:<env>`. A
  failed migration exits non-zero (fails the CI job). `dbmigrate:<env> -- --dry-run`
  reports pending without applying. Requires a `migrate.token` in each server's
  `config.php` and `MIGRATE_TOKEN` / `SITE_URL` in `.env.<env>` (or the env's CI
  secrets). On TEST/QA the whole site is behind HTTP Basic Auth (this host 500s
  on a per-path `.htaccess` exemption), so also set `BASIC_AUTH_USER` /
  `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` — the trigger sends them so it can reach `/api/migrate`; PROD
  has no Basic Auth. Migrations must be idempotent + backward-compatible (see
  `sql/migrations/README.md`).
- **CI auto-deploy to TEST:** the `deploy-test` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  runs `npm run deploy:test` on every merge to `main`, after all other jobs pass.
  Requires four secrets — `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASS`, `FTP_DIR` —
  set on the `test` GitHub Environment (Settings → Environments → `test`), where
  you can also add protection rules. Since that FTP account reaches every
  environment, the per-target path guard applies in CI and `--prune` is never
  used there.
- **QA / PROD deploy (manual gates in CI):** `deploy-qa` and `deploy-prod` are
  jobs in `ci.yml`, gated by Required reviewers on the `qa`/`prod` GitHub
  Environments — approve `deploy-qa` when TEST is green, then `deploy-prod` when
  QA is green, all within the same run. Each needs its own `FTP_DIR` secret
  (scoped to that Environment) plus the shared `FTP_HOST`/`USER`/`PASS`.
  Locally, `npm run deploy:qa` / `npm run deploy:prod` do the same over FTP.
- **Deployment marker:** each deploy writes `deployment.json` to the site root
  (deployed commit, ref, time, run URL). It is force-uploaded every deploy (a SHA
  is a fixed length, so the size-based change check would otherwise skip it) and
  is web-readable at `/deployment.json`.
- **Dev tooling (never deployed):** Composer + PHP_CodeSniffer (PSR-12); Node with
  Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint; Husky + lint-staged; Docker Compose for local dev.

## Architecture

- **`app/` is the tracked source; `public/` is the generated FTP payload.**
  `public/` is produced by `npm run build` and is never hand-edited or committed.
  Never put dev-only files in `app/`. All tooling lives at the repo root
  (`composer.json`, `package.json`, `phpcs.xml`, `docker/`, `config/`, `tools/`,
  `.github/`).
- **Entry point:** `app/index.php` is the single front controller. It requires
  `app/src/bootstrap.php` (autoload + DB connect + session start), then
  dispatches via `nikic/fast-route` using the route table in
  `app/src/routes.php`. Route handlers `require` the matching file under
  `app/pages/` or `app/api/` — both blocked from direct web access by
  `.htaccess`, reachable only through the router.
- **PSR-4 autoloading:** `app/src/` classes are namespaced under `App\` and
  autoloaded via Composer (`composer.json`'s `autoload.psr-4`). No manual
  `require` needed once `vendor/autoload.php` has run (done once, in
  `bootstrap.php`).
- **Auth:** `App\Auth` holds a capability matrix — `user`/`moderator` may
  `respond`; `admin` may `manage_events` / `view_summary`. Not a hierarchy.
  `assets/js/session.js` mirrors it on the client; the server session
  (`window.__sessionRole`) is source of truth.
- **API:** `app/api/*.php` return JSON, reached via `/api/*` clean routes, and
  guard with `Auth::require*`.
- **Config:** the real `app/config.php` is git-ignored. Create it locally with
  `cp config/config.example.php app/config.php`. For Docker, the stack mounts
  `config/config.docker.php` into the container instead. `npm run build` does
  **not** ship `config.php` into `public/` — it's server-owned (real DB creds +
  `env` key), set once per server by hand, and excluded from every
  upload/promotion. So the code artifact is safe to promote test → qa → prod
  unchanged.
- **Environments:** `config.php` carries an `'env'` key (`dev` | `test` | `qa` |
  `prod`). `bootstrap.php` feeds it to `App\Env`, which drives the non-prod
  corner ribbon (`app/partials/env_banner.php`, included from `head.php`;
  styles in `assets/css/main.css`). A missing/unknown value is treated as
  `prod` (no ribbon), so the live site stays clean by default. The two staging
  sites (TEST/QA) are private behind HTTP Basic Auth — their access-control
  overlay and the full deploy layout are documented in `staging/README.md`.
- **Icons:** [Lucide](https://lucide.dev), an npm devDependency bundled by
  Vite — the small fixed icon set actually used is centralized in
  `app/assets/js/icons.js` (`export const icons = { ExternalLink, Menu,
  Pencil, Trash2 }`; add a new icon there, not per call site). Markup:
  `<i data-lucide="icon-name"></i>`, converted to inline `<svg>` by calling
  `createIcons({ icons })` (imported from `'lucide'`) — in `main.js`'s
  `DOMContentLoaded` handler, and again anywhere JS creates icon markup
  dynamically after that (e.g. `planning_repet.js`'s `loadEvents()` calls
  it again after every list rebuild, since the global `DOMContentLoaded`
  call only ever sees the page's initial markup).
  Style is outline/stroke-only (`fill="none"`, `stroke="currentColor"`) —
  there is no solid/filled variant, so never override `fill` on a Lucide
  icon.

  Sizing and orientation are two separate, composable utility classes
  (`app/assets/css/main.css`) applied directly on the `<i data-lucide>`
  placeholder — `createIcons()` copies an element's existing attributes,
  including `class`, onto the `<svg>` it generates, so e.g.
  `<i data-lucide="menu" class="icon-md icon-block"></i>` becomes
  `<svg class="lucide lucide-menu icon-md icon-block">`. Never target an
  icon's size with a per-spot descendant selector (`.foo svg { width:
  ... }`), an arbitrary/one-off value, or `em`/text-relative sizing — a
  discrete, reusable scale keeps every icon's size predictable instead of
  drifting to whatever value happens to look right in one spot, and
  keeping size and orientation as separate classes means either can vary
  independently instead of being bundled per size (e.g. a future icon
  could pair `icon-lg` with `icon-inline`).

  **Size** (pick one): `icon-xs` (0.875rem / 14px), `icon-sm` (1rem /
  16px — icons inline within a run of text or a link label, e.g. the
  Galerie link's external-link icon, sized down so it doesn't inflate
  that element's line-height above its text-only siblings), `icon-md`
  (1.5rem / 24px — standalone icon controls, where the icon *is* the
  whole control, e.g. the nav hamburger, the admin delete/edit icons),
  `icon-lg` (2rem / 32px), `icon-xl` (2.5rem / 40px). `icon-lg`/`icon-xl`
  are prepared but not yet used by any icon in the codebase. The only
  exception to this scale is large-format decorative usage (a hero
  section, a page title, a logo lockup) that isn't really "an icon" —
  those may use a different, purpose-fit size outside this scale.

  **Orientation** (pick one, alongside a size class): `icon-block`
  (`display: block` — for an icon that is the sole content of a control,
  e.g. a button or an absolutely-positioned list-item action, removing
  the small inline-baseline gap under an inline SVG) or `icon-inline`
  (`vertical-align: middle` — for an icon inline within a run of text or
  a link label, aligning it to the surrounding text instead of the SVG's
  own baseline).

  Don't set `stroke` directly — icons inherit `currentColor` from the
  surrounding element's CSS `color`, so hover/state colors are styled on
  the parent as usual.

## Local Development

```bash
docker compose up -d --build   # site: http://localhost:8090, Adminer: http://localhost:8091
docker compose down            # stop
```

The stack's one-shot `vendor` service installs PHP deps into a shared `vendor` volume before
`web` starts (gated by `depends_on: service_completed_successfully`). It gives that vendor an
autoload map for the container's flattened layout (`App\ -> src/`, classes at `/var/www/html/src`),
which the repo-root `vendor/` (`App\ -> app/src/`) does not — see `docker/web/install-vendor.sh`.
No host-side `vendor/` or manual composer step is needed; changing a dependency is picked up on the
next `up`.

Seeded test logins (all passwords `demo`, synthetic data only):
- `demo.admin` — admin (manage events, view summaries)
- `demo.moderator` — moderator (respond)
- `demo.user` — user (respond)

## Development Commands

PHP and Composer normally run in Docker (`php:8.4-cli` / `composer:2`) via
wrappers in `tools/`. First-time setup: `npm install` then `npm run php:install`.

```bash
npm run php:install   # install PHP dev deps into vendor/ (Dockerized Composer; run once)
npm run check         # all checks: php -l + phpcs (Docker), eslint, stylelint, prettier, secret guard
npm run fix           # auto-fix: phpcbf (Docker) + eslint + stylelint + prettier
npm run lint:php      # PHP only (php -l sweep + phpcs, Dockerized)
npm run test:php      # PHPUnit (app/src/**): unit tests + DB-integration tests
```

A Husky pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` on staged files automatically
(PHP hunks are linted through the same Docker wrappers).

### Claude Code web sessions (no Docker)

Web sessions have no Docker daemon. The Docker-free stack is provisioned
**on-demand**, not at session start: `tools/ensure-dev-stack.sh` (via the
cross-platform `tools/ensure-dev-stack.mjs` entry) detects a web session
(`$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`, `docker info` failing) and stands up an equivalent
stack natively — MariaDB installed via `apt` and started directly (no systemd),
`lescanetons` + `lescanetons_test` databases seeded from `docker/db/init/*.sql`,
and `app/config.php` pointed at `127.0.0.1`. It is idempotent and a no-op when
Docker is reachable or outside a web session. It is **not** run from
`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` — apt/DB provisioning is slow enough to blow
the SessionStart hook timeout and stall session init, so the hook only injects
the superpowers skill and stays fast.

`npm run test:php` runs `ensure-dev-stack` first, then PHPUnit; `npm run serve`
does the same, then starts `php -S 127.0.0.1:8090 -t app` (the Apache-container
stand-in). The `tools/composer.mjs` and `tools/php-in-docker.mjs` wrappers fall
back to the locally-installed `composer`/`php`, so `npm run lint:php`,
`npm run fix`, and `npm run test:php` all work unchanged. `IntegrationTestCase`
(in `tests/Integration/`) runs each test in a transaction rolled back in
`tearDown()`, against `lescanetons_test`, so tests never touch dev data.
Local Docker Compose dev is unaffected.

For first-time setup in a web session, run `npm run websession:init` once — it
chains `npm install`, `npm run php:install`, and `ensure-dev-stack` (installing
MariaDB, seeding both databases, writing `app/config.php`) in a single
command, so `npm run check` / `test:php` / `serve` work right after. It's
idempotent and a no-op outside web sessions beyond the plain installs, so it's
also safe to run in local Docker dev.

## Pull Requests

- **Title format:** Conventional Commits — `type(scope): description` (scope optional), matching
  this repo's existing commit-message convention. Enforced by CI
  (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`); a non-conforming title fails the check.
  Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`, `perf`.
  Example: `feat(routing): add clean URLs and old-URL redirects`.
- **Body:** use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (GitHub pre-fills it automatically for new
  PRs) — fill in every section rather than leaving the placeholder comments unedited.

## Language

- **Everything is written in English** — specs and plans (`docs/`), code, comments,
  DB table/column names, enum/stored values, identifiers, slugs, and file names.
- **API JSON response bodies are English** — every `app/api/*.php` error response's
  `error` message, `code`, and `fields[].field`/`fields[].reason` are English
  identifiers/text (e.g. `{"error":"Invalid form submission","code":"validation_failed",
  "fields":[{"field":"date","reason":"required"}]}`). Nothing here is user-facing
  directly — translation to French happens exclusively at the JS display layer, via
  `app/assets/js/i18n.js`'s `translateApiError()` (i18next). `app/api/migrate.php` is
  the one exception: a token-gated deploy-tooling endpoint, never seen by an end user.
- **French is used for ONE thing only: user-visible UI text** (HTML labels, page copy,
  buttons, on-screen event titles/descriptions) — rendered page-level text, not API
  response bodies.
- The existing codebase already follows this: `contact_messages` uses
  `first_name`/`last_name` columns and `responses.answer` uses English enum values
  (`participate`/`notparticipate`), while page labels are French. Match that pattern.

## Dos

- Edit `app/` source in place; run `npm run build` before every FTP deploy.
- Match production versions (PHP 8.4, MariaDB 10.3).
- Run `npm run check` before pushing.
- Put new tooling/config at the repo root, never in `app/`.
- Add new routes in one place: `app/src/routes.php`.

## Don'ts

- Never commit `app/config.php`, `public/`, or any production data / DB dump.
- Never hand-edit `public/` — it's fully regenerated by `npm run build`.
- Never store real member data or passwords in seed files.
